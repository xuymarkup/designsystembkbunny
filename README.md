1.  **`/storybook`**: This directory contains the config files and the stories of the accesories, widgets, components and contentTypes for more info [storybook](http://storybook.js.org/).

2.  **`/assets`**: This directory contains all the assets like logo and fav icon.

3.  **`/lib`**: This directory contains the files of accesories, widgets, components and contentTypes with the styles.

4.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

5.  **`.babelrc`**: This file tells how trapiles the js file.

6.  **`.eslintrc`**: This is a configuration file for [eslint](https://eslint.org/). eslint is a mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your js files.

7.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

8.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

9. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

10.  **`LICENSE`**: WhiteLabel Desing System is licensed under the ISC license.

11. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

##  📑 Documentation

WhiteLabel documentation, included in this repo in the documentation directory, is built with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a standard file format that combines Markdown with JSX. This means you can use Markdown’s terse syntax (such as # heading) for your documentation, write stories that compile to our component story format, and freely embed JSX component blocks at any point in the file. All at once.

## 🤔 Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, WhiteLabel Desing System is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/).
